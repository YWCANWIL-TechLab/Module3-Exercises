# Module3-Exercises

In Module 3, we'll be learning about JavaScript's Data Types, Functions, Objects, and Events. Need a refresher?

In order for our computers to be able to operate on data, they need to know what that data is. In JavaScript we need to be able to understand and work with our 8 Data Types:
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Bigint 
- Undefined
- Null
- Symbol
- Object

Functions 
- Used to organize and reuse code that we have written
- We can use them to react to actions that occur in HTML

Objects
- A complex data type that can have its own properties and methods (functions)
- Great for modeling real life things

Events
- Actions that can occur in HTML, either by the user or by our browser
- Many events begin with the word "on", but not all events will
- Examples include: onclick, onmouseover, onmouseoff
